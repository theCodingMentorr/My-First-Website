  <strong>The chicken</strong> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
  junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the
  Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock
  are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
  male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
  and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
  primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
  Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced
  in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are
  layers.

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
  Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
  communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual
  chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order, with
  dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.
  Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
  social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
  younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation
  needed] Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator.
  At least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34]
  A group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their
  coop.[35] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may
  puff up its feathers.[

<h3>Biology and habitat</h3>

<p>
  Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a
  total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion
  in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
  numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and religion, and
  in language and literature. Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal
  origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but
  the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated
  from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the
  Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century
  BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land
  between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
  III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]
